# ServiceNow-Service-Catalog

Scenario:
**Service Catalog Item**
You're a new ServiceNow admin at DXC Technology, and your team just received a request from IT leadership:<br>

"We need to add the new iPhone 16 to the Service Catalog so employees can request it. Make sure it's properly categorized, priced, and includes storage and color options. And don't forget to follow access controls â€” only authorized editors should be able to manage catalog items." <br>

Your task is to: <br>

1. Create a Catalog Administrators group and assign the proper role.
2. Add team member to that group so he can manage catalog items.
3. Use Catalog Builder to create a new item for the iPhone 16.
4. Add dropdowns for Storage (256 GB / 512 GB) and Color (Space Black / Silver).
5. Add pricing logic (e.g., $100 extra for 512 GB).
6. Make the item active and test it from the Self-Service portal.
